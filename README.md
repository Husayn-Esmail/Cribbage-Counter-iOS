#  Cribbage Counter iOS

This app is a very simple counter to take the place of a cribbage board in the event that
you have cards but no cribbage board. I originally created this app for apple watch but
later decided that it would be interesting to create one for iOS as well. However, at this
point it was too late or I didn't know how to create the iOS target and therefore created a
new project. Live and learn...

After I created the iOS version I copied the code from the watchOS target over to this
repository to create a consolidated experience. I had plans to extend this app and make it
more interesting but ultimately, I haven't gotten around to doing it because other more
necessary software has taken my focus.

Overall though, it was fun learning some fundamental concepts of iOS and watchOS development
like creating views, navigation, changing state, and working with swiftUI through this project
and I used the app quite a bit before I got tired of having to
renew the certificate every week.
